  # NodeManager manages a list of redis nodes. Upon startup, the NodeManager
  # will discover the current redis master and slaves. Each redis node is
  # monitored by a NodeWatcher instance. The NodeWatchers periodically
  # report the current state of the redis node it's watching to the
  # NodeManager. The NodeManager processes the state reports and reacts
  # appropriately by handling stale/dead nodes, and promoting a new redis master
  # if it sees fit to do so.
